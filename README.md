## Overview

The Amazon Redshift Project is aimed at demonstrating effective data management and analysis using Amazon Redshift, a fully managed data warehouse service in the cloud. The `Amazon_RedShift_Project_Documentation` pdf file is divided into four main parts:

1. Introduction: Provides an overview of the project objectives and outlines the contents of the documentation.
   
2. Preparation of the Environment: Details the setup process, including creating a virtual private cloud (**VPC**), setting up **subnets**, creating an Amazon **S3** bucket, and configuring **IAM** roles and **security groups**.

3. Interaction with Amazon Redshift: Explains how to create a **Redshift cluster**, configure database tables, import data from S3, and run queries using the Redshift query editor.

4. Conclusion: Summarizes the project outcomes and discusses future considerations.

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

For those interested in replicating my cloud infrastructure setup, I provide *Infrastructure as Code* (**IaC**) files in the `Amazon-Redshift_S3-Data_Pipeline` directory. You can find both [YAML](https://github.com/kevinndungu-source/Amazon_Redshift_S3_Data_Pipeline/blob/main/Project's_Code/Amazon_RedShift_Cloud_Formation_Stack_YAML_Code.yml) and [JSON](https://github.com/kevinndungu-source/Amazon_Redshift_S3_Data_Pipeline/blob/main/Project's_Code/Amazon_RedShift_Cloud_Formation_Stack_JSON_Code.json) formats of my cloud formation stack templates, enabling easy deployment and scalability.

### Deployment Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `Amazon-Redshift_S3-Data_Pipeline` `/Project's_Code` files directory.
3. Choose the appropriate cloud formation stack template (**YAML** or **JSON**) for your deployment.
4. Deploy the stack using the **AWS CloudFormation** console or **CLI**. Refer to the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/overview-deployment-options/aws-cloudformation.html) for detailed instructions on deploying CloudFormation stacks.
